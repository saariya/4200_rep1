                Music is an integral part of our lives. It is a medium of showing and feeling expression and understanding emotion which is shared throughout all the demographics of the human population. We as a group enjoy listening to music and we know everyone else does too. We all want to keep up with the trending songs and listen to what others are listening, as if other people liked it there is a good chance you will too.But what makes a song popular? And how do different music streaming apps determine that? We tried to answer this question by using spotify which is arguably the most widely used platform for music. This project explores the factors that contribute to a songâ€™s popularity by analyzing 20 qualitative and quantitative features, including both continuous and discrete variables. Using a dataset of 114,000 songs with attributes like energy, danceability, acousticness, genre, artist name, duration and many more, we examine how these features correlate with popularity through various visualizations created with Altair, Matplotlib, and D3. To present our findings interactively, we built a website using HTML and CSS, allowing users to engage with the data dynamically. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that define what makes a song successful and provide us the basis for discovering songs that could become popular.
