            <ul class="plot-list">
                <li>Due to the large sample size we try to infer the results based on the top 3 genres and
                    we can observe generally (through the trend line) that with the danceability of a song the popularity of it increases as well. </li>
                <li>From this visualization we try to see the relationship between popularity and danceability trying to figure out if a song is popular
                    if people prefer to dance on it or not.</li>
                <li> When we notice the genres we can denote that mostly all punk rock music lies above the trend line but the other 2 genres, 
                    acoustic and progressive house are averaged around the trend line.</li>

            <h3>What this plot does</h3>
            <ul class="plot-list">
                <li>The majority of popular songs (scoring 50-100 on the popularity axis) tend to have shorter durations, primarily clustering below 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>There's a clear negative correlation between duration and popularity - as songs get longer (especially beyond 20 minutes), they generally receive lower popularity scores. </li>
                <li>Extremely long songs (40+ minutes) are rare and typically receive lower popularity scores, though there are a few notable exceptions.</li>
                <li>The densest concentration of data points is in the 2-5 minute range with high popularity scores, suggesting this may be an optimal song length for audience appeal.</li>

            <ul class="plot-list">
                <li>The vast majority of songs are very short, with the highest concentration (approximately 145 songs) falling in the 0-4 minute range.               </li>
                <li>The second most common duration is the 4-8 minute range (about 80-85 songs). There's a sharp decline after 8 minutes, with only about 20 songs in the 8-12 minute range. </li>
                <li>Songs longer than 12 minutes are relatively rare, with counts mostly below 5 per bin. There are occasional longer songs appearing throughout the distribution, with small spikes around 44-48 minutes and 80-84 minutes. There are occasional longer songs appearing throughout the distribution, with small spikes around 44-48 minutes and 80-84 minutes. The overall distribution is heavily right-skewed (or positively skewed), with a long tail extending to longer durations.</li>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
        From our analysis, we observed several key trends in music popularity. Most songs tend to be short, with a peak duration of 2-4 minutes, and longer songs (over 10 minutes) are rare. Additionally, shorter songs tend to be more popular, as indicated by a negative correlation between duration and popularity—songs under 10 minutes are more likely to have higher popularity ratings.
        Genre also plays a role in popularity distribution. In the case of alt-rock, the data reveals a bimodal trend, where some songs achieve moderate to high popularity while others remain obscure. Meanwhile, danceability appears to have a slight positive relationship with popularity across acoustic, punk-rock, and progressive-house genres. Punk-rock songs tend to be more common at higher danceability values, whereas progressive-house tracks are more consistently clustered in the mid-range of both metrics.
        Overall, our findings suggest that shorter, more danceable songs generally perform better in terms of popularity. However, genre-specific trends highlight that other factors, such as niche appeal and audience preferences, also play a significant role in a song’s success.</p></section>
